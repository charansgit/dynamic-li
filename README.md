# dynamic-li

Hi There,

This repository is mainly used for displaying the dynamic list on the web page. Data source for the list is refered from a file named "listdata.js" and this data gets parsed in "script.js".

To run this project, you can just clone this repo and then open "index.html" in any browser. Thanks
